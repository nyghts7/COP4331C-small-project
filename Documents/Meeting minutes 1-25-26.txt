Meeting Notes from 1/25/26:

Present: Julio, Luciano, Fabian, Tim, Aviel

Topics covered: what our roles are, what we each need to learn, general outline for what needs to be done,

Colors lab seems to give a lot of what we need for this project:
	web hosting, php files, javascript files, html files
	similar functionality: 3 API points, each user has own set of colors, each 
		user logs in, partial search matches

Already got hosting and domain set up. Working on GitHub automatically pushing to server

Front end: needs to know HTML/CSS and Javascript (look at example files and links posted in chat)

Back end: needs to know PHP and SwaggerHub (look at example files and links posted in chat)

Database: pretty much identical to Colors lab, need to make an ERD for the slides

Not sure how to split tasks among groups: possibly break into 2 meeting groups as we develop, front end and back end to discuss who does what.

Powerpoint slides: be sure to remember what you find interesting as we learn and develop, we will need to create a presentation later. Every person should talk max 1.5ish minutes?

Lighthouse accessibility report - browser plugin to help check for accessibility issues. Keep in mind as we develop (for example: dyslexic friendly fonts, color-blind awareness)

Need to ask professor about Gantt chart in the rubric.
