# To Do

## Database 

- [ ] Create SQL Tables

   * Contacts will need JS to search and populate tables
   * Index, createLogin, and Login need to send credentials and receive answers
- [ ] Lighthouse ratings can be improved
   * images can be optimized for performance
   * accessibility should be higher

## Back End

- [ ] API points need to be done
   * Any already started? Do we have requirements for the database tables? 
   * (can have as many API points as we want, but can only demo 2 at presentation)
- [ ] SwaggerHub API Demonstration

## Project Manager

- [ ] PowerPoint Slides
   * everyone should contribute to slides so you know what you're presenting.
- [ ] Gantt chart
   * based on how long stages of development took. Need input from people
